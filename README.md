# musics-auto-sort
My Very First Bash Script

I have a folder full of music in which I tried to categorize the music based on their singing

For example, I have a folder called "Inna", which will put all Inna's songs in it or another folder called "Lady gaga" for this singer

After some time do not sort the files. I encountered a lot of unordered files. And I did not know how to sort these files until I wrote this script

Typically, the names of songs are in this format:
"Artist Name - Song Name.mp3"
and the folder names are like :
"artist name" or "Artist name"

with this script and this name format i could sort over 90% of my files and sorting that 10% manually is so simple
